  <p>Formed in 2007 by ex-Eames Era guitarist/songwriters Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer, New Orleans-based indie pop outfit Generationals craft hook-filled tunes that draw liberally from rock and pop's '50s, '60s, and '70s heyday while maintaining enough modern sensibilities to remain relevant in the MP3 age. Like their early labelmates Dr. Dog, Spinto Band, and Capitol Years, Generationals' lo-fi recording techniques are buffered by their advance musical chops, resulting in a clever new take on sugar pop psychedelia.</p>

  <p>The band's Park the Van debut, Con Law, arrived on July 2009. They returned in 2011 with the equally sugary-sweet sophomore effort Actor-Caster. Two years later, the group moved to Polyvinyl, which delivered their thrid stufio LP, Heza, followed in 2014 by the '80s synth-pop-influenced Alix. Both of those albums hit the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart. Generationals celebrated their new label's 20th anniversary in 2016 by covering "In Green" by <b>Volcano, I'm Still Excited!!</b> for the Polyvinyl Plays Polyvinyl collection.</p>
